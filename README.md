# REAL Curriculum Builder

REAL Curriculum is a curriculum strategy and platform that focuses on preparing teachers to teach better than ever before through daily devotions, allowing them to teach from the overflow of their own time in the Word. REAL Curriculum and all related apps are designed and produced by Unshifting Shadows.

The REAL Curriculum Builder is a tool used to produce curriculum in any form (whether it be lessons, sermons, etc.). Currently only being used by the REAL Curriculum team, it is made available on Github for anyone to fork and use with their own database.

The design focuses on building lessons through building blocks called modules. These modules combine to form all the individual pieces one might use in a lesson. Any media for these lessons are hosted and managed by [Notes and Quotes](notesandquotes.unshiftingshadows.com), another Unshifting Shadows app.
